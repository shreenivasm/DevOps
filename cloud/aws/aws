How to choose regions
	Complience : Data governance & legal requirements
	proximity : Reduced latency
	Available service:
	Pricing: 

AZ
	usually : 3
	min : 2
	max : 6

Edge locations

Global Service 

	IAM
	R53
	CloudFront
	WAF (Web application firewall)			
-----------------------------------------------

IAM - Identity Access Management

	Users 
	Groups
	Permissions
	Roles

Lab -
	Users -> Add user -> 

	Standard - Use IAM user instead of ROOT account


IAM Security Tools

	IAM Credentials report (A/C level) - List your accout's users & status of there credentials.

	IAM Access Advisor (User level) - Show service permission granted to user & when those service last were accessed.

	Guidelines
		Don't use the root account except for aws a/c setup.
		One physical user = one aws user
		Use Access Key for programatic access (CLI/SDK)
		Create & Use Role for giving permissions to AWS Services.
		Use & Enforce MFA
		Create a strong pwd policy
		assign users to groups & assign permissions to groups.

EC2

	Placement groups
		1) Cluster
			Pros - All EC2 are in same AZ(Racks), Low latency, 10GBPS N/w.
			Cons - If racks fails, all instances fails at the same time.
			Use Case : 
				Big data jobs that need to be complete fast.
				Application that need extremely low latency & high n/w throughput.
			
		2) Spread
			Pros : Spans across multiple AZ.
				Reduced risk is simultaneous failure.
 			Cons : Limited to 7 instances per AZ, per placement group.
			Use Case :
				Application that need maximum availablity.
				Critical applications where each instance must isolated from failure from each other.
		3) Partition
			Upto 7 partitions per AZ.
			Can span across multiple AZs in the same region.
			Up to 100s of EC2 instances.
			Instances the partition do not share racks with instance in the other partitions.
			A partition failure can affect many EC2 but won't affect other partitions. 
			EC2 instance get access to the partition information as metadata.
			Use Case : HDFS, HBase, Cassandra, Kafka.

	Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)		
		Logical compnent in VPC that represents a Virtual network card
		ENI can have following attributes
			Primary private IPV4, one or more secondary IPV4
			One Elastic (IPV4) per private IPV4
			One or more security groups
			A MAC address.
		You can create ENI independently & attach them on the fly (move them) on instances
		for failure.
		Bound to specific AZ.

	EC2 Hibernate
		The in memory state is preserved.
		Instance boot is much faster.
		Under the hood : The RAM state is written to the file in the root EBS Volume.
		The root EBS volume must be encrypted.
		Use Cases:
			Long running processing.
			Saving the RAM state.
			Service that take time to initialize.
		Good to Know :
			Supported instances families : C3,C4,C5,M3,M4,M5,R3,R4 & R5 					.
			Instance RAM size : Must be less than 150 GB.
			Instance size : Not supported for bare metal instances.
			AMI : Amazon linux 2, Linux AMI, Ubuntu ... & windows.
			Root volume : must be EBS , encrypted, not instance store & large.
			Available for : OD & Reserved instances.
			An instance cannot be hibernated more than 60 days.

	EC2 Nitro
		Underlying platform for next genration of EC2 instances.
		New Virtualization technlogy.
		Allows for better performance.
			Better n/w options. (enhanced n/w,HPC, IPV6)
			Higher speed EBS(Nitro is necessary for 64000 EBS IOPS. - max 32000 on non nitro)
		Better undelying security.
		Instance types e.g.
			Virtualized - AI, C5, C5a, C5ad, C5d, C5n, C6g, C6gd, C6gn, D3, D3en, G4...
			Barmetal - aI.metal, c5.metal,c5d.metal....
